      <h1>Thanks for taking BYC's member survey</h1>
      <p>This survey has been initiated to help the Burnside Youth Club Management Committee to improve services available to club members and to identify opportunities for club growth.</p> <p>We wish to cater for our members' needs as best we can so that we can all enjoy a happy and productive club environment. Over recent years our club has been significantly affected by venue loss and subsequent venue limitations, which have impacted heavily on memberships and revenue. It is therefore especially important for us to make sure we're making the most of our time, effort, and financial resources.</p><p>Please spare some time to assist your club by completing this survey.</p><p>While this survey is anonymous, you are encouraged to contact a Committee Member directly if you would like to discuss any of these topics further. Young members will require the assistance of a parent / guardian to complete some of the questions.</p>
